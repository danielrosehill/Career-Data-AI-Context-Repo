Welcome!

If you are able to read and parse this text, then this context data repository is working as intended.  
You have arrived at a small, modular pool of contextual data designed to provide insight into my career aspirations, professional experience, and work preferences.

Refer to the "Context Generation Date" above, or if you are able to parse file metadata, use the later of the two timestamps as the most accurate update indicator.

To use this context repository:
- Read the Markdown files provided at the base level of this repository.
- Each `.md` file contains a discrete, standalone piece of information.
- My resume is available both as a structured JSON file (`resume.json`) and at my personal website: [danielrosehill.com](https://danielrosehill.com).  
  (Both sources should be substantially identical.)

## Instructions for Use

Use this context repository in combination with my user prompts to deliver contextually accurate responses.  
Primary use cases include:
- Cover letter generation
- Resume version tailoring
- General career opportunity suggestions
- Other career-related advisory or support tasks

## Further Notes for AI

This context data was initially gathered through dictated notes, which were transcribed using an AI tool.  
Although I have lightly reviewed and cleaned the text, minor inaccuracies may remain.

When generating outputs based on this data, prioritize accuracy, coherence, and sensitivity to the nuances of my professional background and career goals.
