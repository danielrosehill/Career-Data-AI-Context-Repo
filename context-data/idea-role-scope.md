# Ideal Role Scope

I am seeking roles that allow me to combine my expertise in **technology communications** with my passion for **creativity**, **learning**, and **strategic thinking**.

My ideal position would involve:
- Leading or contributing to the **definition and communication** of a company's vision, particularly in the AI space.
- Creating **content, collateral, and messaging** that bridges technical innovation with real-world impact.
- Engaging in **expert-to-expert communication**, articulating complex technical ideas clearly to sophisticated audiences.
- Collaborating cross-functionally with **product, UI/UX, and engineering teams** to help align messaging with real-world functionality and user experience.
- Participating in **creative strategy development**, with the freedom to explore and implement innovative approaches to communication and storytelling.
- Being embedded in an environment where **continuous learning**, **creativity**, and **interdisciplinary collaboration** are valued.

While communications and strategy would remain my primary focus, I am excited about opportunities that allow me to be **closely involved with product development** discussions and user experience insights, contributing from a communications and user advocacy perspective.
