# Working Style

I thrive in environments that balance **focused, independent work** with **effective, structured collaboration**.

I typically organize my workflow into **periods of deep focus**, where I advance projects independently, followed by **coordination points** such as meetings or status updates to align with teams and stakeholders.

I am highly experienced with remote collaboration tools, including **Zoom**, **Slack**, **Asana**, and **Monday.com**, and I am fully self-sufficient in managing remote work logistics.  
I primarily work on **Linux (Ubuntu)** and am comfortable with a wide range of open-source and cloud-based productivity tools.

I have been working effectively in **remote and hybrid** environments since **2015** and am open to remote or Jerusalem-based opportunities.
