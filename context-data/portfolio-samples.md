# Portfolio Summary

## Global Value Factors Derivative Database
I developed and open-sourced a derivative of the **Global Value Factors Database (GVFD)**, in collaboration with the **International Foundation for Valuing Impacts (IFVI)**.

- Converted the original XLSM-based dataset into an accessible, open-source format.
- Released publicly on **Hugging Face**, making the dataset available for broader use by NGOs, researchers, and policymakers.
- The dataset has been **downloaded over 3,000 times**, reflecting significant community interest and utility.

## Context Management and AI Experimentation Projects
I have built and released multiple projects exploring **personalized AI systems**, **context management**, and **agentic workflows**:

- **Agentic Context Development Interview Demo** — A Streamlit-based multi-agent workflow to develop structured user context.  
  [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/danielrosehill/Agentic-Context-Development-Interview-Demo)
  
- **Context Chunker Assistant** — A preprocessing tool for preparing user context data for RAG-based AI systems.
