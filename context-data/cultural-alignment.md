# Company Culture Preferences

I am energized by organizations that value:
- **Long-term vision** over short-term gains
- **Creative thinking** and **practical innovation**
- **Outcome-driven contributions** rather than appearances
- **Thoughtful adoption of technology**, particularly in emerging areas like AI

I appreciate companies that foster a culture of **respectful collaboration**, **idea-sharing**, and **a commitment to delivering real-world impact**.

I am drawn to environments where creativity, strategic thinking, and continuous learning are actively encouraged.
