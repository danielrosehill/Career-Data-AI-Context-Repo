# AI Interests

I am deeply passionate about developing and working with AI systems that prioritize **personalization**, **practical utility**, and **empowerment of individual users**.

Rather than focusing exclusively on enterprise-scale RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) implementations, I am particularly interested in how AI can enable **personalized, everyday experiences** that save users time, reduce decision fatigue, and enhance quality of life.

My areas of particular interest include:
- Building **personalized AI systems** that can manage personal context data effectively to improve outputs.
- Creating agentic workflows that move from **information retrieval** to **practical action**.
- Exploring the convergence of **context management** and **tool execution** through emerging standards such as **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.
- Developing AI agents that can meaningfully **integrate into daily life** â€” for example, by streamlining decisions like entertainment selection, drafting job applications, or automating scheduling tasks.

I see a future where AI moves beyond passive information retrieval into **active, helpful participation in everyday workflows**.
