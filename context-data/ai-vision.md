# Vision for AI

I believe in the transformative potential of AI to:
- **Enhance human creativity and productivity**
- **Democratize access to powerful technology tools**
- **Support meaningful improvements in everyday life and work**

My particular interests include:
- **Context management** and **personalized AI systems**
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** workflows
- **Agent-based workflow orchestration**
- **Automated knowledge management**
- **AI for therapeutic applications** (under appropriate supervision)

I am especially motivated to contribute to AI initiatives that are grounded in **responsible development**, **strategic foresight**, and a commitment to **empowering users** rather than replacing them.
