# Vision for the Future of AI

I believe the future of AI lies in **bringing technology closer to people's real needs** — not by overwhelming users with information, but by **intelligently assisting with real-world tasks**.

In particular, I am motivated by:
- Developing **personalization-first AI experiences** that adapt to individual users, not just organizations.
- Applying **tooling standards** like MCP to make AI agents capable of interacting with real-world services and platforms.
- Enabling **workflow orchestration** where AI can move from "what should I do?" to actually assisting with doing it.
- Making AI **more accessible** for underrepresented or underserved groups, including those with **neurodiversity**, by tailoring educational content and support systems to individual cognitive styles.
- Exploring **AI in mental health** — for example, supplementing therapy through role-play exercises and supportive conversational agents (with appropriate clinical oversight).

Ultimately, I envision AI as a technology that should **reduce friction**, **enhance human agency**, and **augment creativity**, not replace it.
